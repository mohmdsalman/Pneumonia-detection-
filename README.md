# ðŸ§  Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project is a deep learning-based web application that detects **pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model. It also includes an interactive chatbot to answer pneumonia-related queries.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early. Traditional methods of diagnosis through X-rays require expert radiologists and can be slow or error-prone.  
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-based system that can automatically classify chest X-rays as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**, and assist in early diagnosis.
